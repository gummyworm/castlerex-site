<h2>Moving Part I</h2>
<p>Well it's moving day...again.  I have moved (at least once) every single
year since graduating high school. But this...THIS...is the biggest one yet.
Not in terms of possesions. Per usual, I have lined up rubber maid tubs like a
small cargo train ready to be escorted right out the door, and I hope the whole 
process will take no more than an hour.  Nay, this move is big because instead
of ping-ponging around Iowa I will be taking a one-way flight...<i>somewhere</i>
else.</p>
<p>Yeah, Somewhere.  Presently, I'm seriously considering moving to New York City.  
The Big Apple.  If I do, I will absolutely not be bringing any vintage computers or electronic supplies  along.
This is not just because I won't have room for them, but because the very idea
of owning <i>things</i> in big city environmet, one filled with bugs and general 
filth, brings me great anxiety.  In a way, that is part of what draws me
toward that city.  I will have no choice but to adopt, for my own sanity,
a sort of minimalist lifestyle.</p>
<p>Minimalism appeals to me.  It's hard not to see the allure.  No possesions to
drag you down.  The freedom to not worry about looking for, taking care of,
or keeping inventory of one's possesions. Mate, if there's a way to live <i>that</i>
is it.  Moving has also made me confront the sheer number of clothes I own.
This has made me revisit the idea of a "social uniform".  An idea I first heard
about through Steve Jobs, and first took to heart through a conversation with
a friend a couple years back.
<p>For me, the appeal it is not just that it eliminates the need to choose what to
wear.  Actually, that's not even part of the appeal.  I like that there is
absolutely no reason to own, say, 20 different shirts.  At some level, fashion
does interest me, so it is easy to justify owning 20 different shirts when each
one is only fit for certain occasions or as part of a specific outfit.  With
a social uniform, the only test a shirt needs to pass to determine whether to
keep or discard it is its condition.</p>
<p>Anyway, huge digression...let's move on</p>

<p>Besides NYC, allow me to muse on another prospective move.  I could move back
to Springfield, MO, a city that I truly love despite its consistent ranking as
one of the worst cities in America.  It is one of the cheapest places to live
in the entire US, and I could easily buy a nice LOFT =) (I love lofts) 
or house where I could pursue all sorts of creative material endeavors. Having
a hardware lab would be an attainable dream. Easily attainable. But, though few
things are more enjoyable than warming up that soldering iron and digging through
disorderly bins of wires and IC's, I know that on some level these things aren't
making me happy- long term, that is.</p>
<p>At this very moment, I'm kinda torn by these two very opposite destinations.
One of the most expensive cities in America versus one of the cheapest.  Owning
a beautiful space or throwing away twice as much to rent a freaking broom closet.  
It's not just some "lifestyle" pulling me to NYC. It's just so far outside my comfort zone
and so demanding on my perspective of how to live. That isn't to say
the lifestyle does not appeal to me. Competition breeds quality, and the necessity to
fight for one's survival in the most populous city in the USA has objectively
produced a city that is world class in every imaginable way: fashion, art, cuisine,
nightlife, name it...That would be, if nothing else, neat to experience.</p>
<p>I've kind of given myself two extremes here...There are other options.  Denver
would be a logical place to move.  But, well, we'll see..</p>
<p>Even as I've typed this my conviction to at least visit NYC has grown.
If I don't fall in love, so be it. I can't see myself being there forever.  But I don't
think it's an experience I should deprive myself of either.</p>

<h2>Moving Part II</h2>
<p>Ahhh, well, the hard part is over.  All my possesions have been packed and are
out of sight and mind for the time being.  What a relief.</p>
<p>Having everything gone already makes me feel better about the move. With the
first hurdle cleared, I can set my eyes on the next. Soooo, this move...what do 
I take...I will be flying, which greatly limits what possesions I can carry.
My desktop (iMac) is clearly out.  As are both my guitars. Realistically, I could
take <i>maybe</i> two suitcases and a backpack.  But, let's use this opportunity
to REALLY go minimalist. I'll take just one suitcase and one backpack. This is
what I took to Israel, and it was plenty sufficient for a month long trip. I
never missed anything, so it is definitely enough. In each vessel I will
pack the following:</p>

<p>Backpack:
<ul>
	<li>Laptop (Macbook Air)</li>
	<li>Work Laptop (Macbook Pro 2015)</li>
	<li>Laptop charger</li>
	<li>Phone (USB-C) charger</li>
	<li>Kindle</li>
	<li>micro USB cable</li>
	<li>mp3 player</li>
	<li>mouse</li>
	<li>headphones</li>
	<li>passport</li>
	<li>glasses</li>
	<li>sunglasses</li>
	<li>Nintendo Switch</li>
	<li>Nintendo Switch games</li>
	<li>Nintendo 3DS</li>
	<li>Nintendo 3DS games</li>
	<li>The Way of Kings (book I'm reading)</li>
	<li>Grooming supplies: toothbrush, brush, razer, nail clippers.</li>
	<li>razer charger</li>
	<li>Contact solution, toothpaste</li>
	<li>Contacts</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>Suitcase:
<ul>
	<li>1 pair jeans</li>
	<li>4 pairs shorts</li>
	<li>light jacket</li>
	<li>jean jacket</li>
	<li>8 shirts</li>
	<li>socks/underwear</li>
	<li>shoes</li>
	<li>athletic wear:2 shorts + 2 shirts</li>
	<li>swim trunks</li>
</ul>
</p>

Apologies if this is neither helpful or interesting.  In my mind, writing this
has helped me visualize what I need to pack.

Off the plane, I will Uber to an AirBnB somewhere.  I haven't decided exactly
where to stay yet, but I am strongly leaning toward somewhere in Brooklyn.
Currently the top neighborhoods I'm considering are Bushwick and Williamsburg.
Bushwick has the cost advantage; Williamsburg- location.
