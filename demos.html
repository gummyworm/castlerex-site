<h2>Demos</h2>
<p>
Since I began coding, my dream was to write amazing demos for Commodore
64. Edge of Disgrace by Booze Design was especially influential. In those
early days, I was cutting my teeth on Z-80 assembly for the TI-83/84+ graphing
calculators, but I finally did get my own Commodore machine in March of 2009: a
Commodore Vic-20. Quite comically, the decision to buy a Vic instead of a C64
came down to cost even 25 years past both of the machine's relevance.
I'm still pretty far from releasing anything notable, but it remains a goal
of mine to oneday release something I'm truly proud of, in that "beat this" sort of scene way, at a major demo party. 
<p>Anyway, here are the demos I've made.  All two of them are seasonal demos.  Turns out having a hard deadline is pretty
important in actually releasing a prod. For me, that deadline has been
Christmas.  Somewhere out there, there exist the beginnings of a Christmas demo
for the years 2010, 2011, and 2013, but I'm pretty happy to have been able to finish these two.
</p>

<p>
Fair warning: these are not good.  In fact, they're quite bad- especially in the audio department.  But if I don't
archive them somewhere even I am sure to forget of their existence.
I actually had to hunt down an archive of the Vic 20 Demobase, which itself has
been abandoned, to find a copy of the '09 demo, which has apparently been evicted from its original home on my Microsoft Live drive.

<p>This was a weekend project I made my last year of high school.
I was pretty proud to show it off to my family at the time, and I've played
it for them on a few Christmas Eve's since. :) Despite its rough edges, I received very warm feedback
from the community upon its release.  I will always love the Vic-20 community
for its kindness.<p>

<p>Another Christmas demo rushed together after graduating college.  This one features some decent effects IMHO.  I mean its got rasters, its got a plasma,
its got a scrolltext...what more could you ask for!? :D
But, seriously, this too was hacked together over just a couple days. It's not
winning any awards for design</p>
