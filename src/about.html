<p>Hello.  I'm Bryce.  My interests include vintage computing, making and eating hummus, and the consumption and production of all forms of media.</p>

This site takes its name of one of my first projects: a point and click
adventure game for the Vic-20. Pray that one day you (and I) see its release. :)</p>
