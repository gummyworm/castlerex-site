<h2>Recipe</h2>

	<li>juice of 1/2 medium lemon</li>
	<li>1-3 cloves of garlic</li>
	<li>1/2 cup tahini</li>

	<li>1/2 Tbsp cumin</li>

</ul>

<p>
If you are just making hummus for the first time, using canned chickpeas is
a great way to get a feel for the process! Even having made many, many
batches of hummus the hard way, I often fall back to a canned recipe when
I want hummus in an instant.</p>

<p>
The beautiful thing about this recipe is that it is almost completely
foolproof.  You simply add all the ingredients to a food processor or
blender and run it until you're satisfied with the consistency.  The result
will not be as smooth as soaked and cooked chickpeas, but the taste will
blow away anything you can buy in a store.

It is not even important to be exact in these amounts.  Every ingredient
can be modified to taste, and I rarely measure any of them. The more you
make hummus, the more you'll get a feel for what you personally like.</p>

<p>
The flavors will taste best after at least a few hours of refrigeration, but,
when I'm making hummus from canned beans it's often because I want it <i>now</i>.
So, if you want to eat it straight out of the food processor- still good! :)</p>
