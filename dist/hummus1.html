<h1>Quick Hummus</h1>

<h2>Recipe</h2>
<h3>ingredients</h3>
<ul>
	<li>1 can (15-16oz) drained chickpeas/garbanzo beans</li>
	<li>juice of 1/2 medium lemon</li>
	<li>1-3 cloves of garlic</li>
	<li>1/2 cup tahini</li>
	<li>1/4 tsp salt</li>
	<li>1/2 Tbsp cumin</li>
	<li>water (to desired thickness)</li>
</ul>

<p>
If you are just making hummus for the first time, using canned chickpeas is
a great way to get a feel for the process! Even having made many, many
batches of hummus the hard way, I often fall back to a canned recipe when
I want hummus in an instant.</p>

<p>
The beautiful thing about this recipe is that it is almost completely
full proof.  You simply add all the ingredients to a food processor or
blender and run it until you're satisfied with the consistency.  The result
will not be as smooth as cooked and soaked chickpeas, but the taste will
blow away anything you can buy in a store.

It is not even important to be exact in these amounts.  Every ingredient
can be modified to taste, and I rarely measure any of them.</p>

<p>
The flavors will taste best after at least a few hours of refrigeration, but,
when I'm making hummus from canned beans it's often because I want it <i>now</i>.
So, if you want to eat it straight out of the food processor- still good!</p>
