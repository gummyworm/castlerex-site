<p>Progress was a little slower the last few days, unfortunately.</p>

<p>I've done a bit additional pixelling.  On the code front, the last few days have been focused on
cleaning up various rough edges.  Those include a few regressions.  I had offset the spare RAM
buffer, forgetting that it needs to be aligned on a page bounday.  This caused a few issues in
some self modfiying code that was just setting the LSB of the target addresses.  Ultimately this
led to some visual issues in the sprite rendering.</p>

<p>As far as new features go, I've been working on the "effects" part of the engine.
The purpose of this is to give some visual flair to various actions.  It's bascially
a higher level layer that sits ontop of the bitmap API, which sets/resets pixels.
Currently, it supports lines (horizontal and vertical), and flashes, which are done
by writing to the VIC's screen color register, $900f. So, it is quite primitive.
</p>

<p>The bitmap manipulating actions are bounded by the room's visible area, which is an
intentional limitation to allow the operations to be undone by restoring the room data
from a back buffer.</p>

<p>Finally, although it isn't implemented yet :D, the operations <i>should</i> honor
a stroke width.</p>

<p>As always, hope you all are well. Til next time :) I'm making another loaf of bread on Friday or Saturday, can't wait!</p>
