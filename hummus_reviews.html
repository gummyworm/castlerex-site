<h1>Hummus of NYC</h1>
<hr>

<h1>Chelsea</h1>

<h2>Hummus and Pita Co.</h2>
6th Ave @ W. 17th
<p>I never have high hopes for chain restaraunts.  Even so, all hummus deserves a
chance.  Despite being a big franchise, Hummus and Pita Co. is actually pretty dang good.
The prices are more than fair and the variety of sides is excellent.  
The hummus is surprisingly excellent.  It is creamy and has a good taste and
texture.  The baba ganoush is less excellent with little to no smoky taste.
It is, somewhat confusingly, served as two varieties: vegan and non-vegan.
Both are pretty mediocre.  In fact, compared to any good baba, they're actually 
pretty bad. The "Turkish salad" is quite good.  It resembles matbucha and has 
a good tomatoey/onion flavor.  Most of the other salads are average, but the
variety is nice.  The falafel is not so good.  It is way over-fried and has
a thick, crunchy exterior. The pita is actually quite good- better than most hummus
places I've been.  For me, this is a good, safe choice if I'm looking for a lot
of food and a lot of variety.

<h2>Middle Eats</h2>
<p>What a sleeper!  Middle Eats is situated in an unfortunate location.  Surrounded by
mediocre chains and tourist money-grabs, it does not inspire confidence.  The
exterior of the building, and the whole cutesy branding only compound this, but for 
a grab-and-go lunch spot, none of that matters!  The hummus here is outstanding.
It definitely gives the nearby Bite a run for its money.  The falafel
is great too.  It is large, unlike Taim, and moist, unlike Hummus and Pita Co.
The menu is not very diverse, and the sides: rice, couscous, and Arabic salad
are pretty bland, but the hummus, falafel, and pita (chewy and bready) save it.

<h1>Flatiron</h1>

<h2>Bite</h2>
Flatiron
<p>Goooood hummus, guys. Bite is probably the best hummus in the Flatiron area.
It is also one of the precious few areas that serves hummus as a main dish.  The hummus bowls come topped with one of a few options
including salad/egg, roasted peppers, and, my personal favorite, sauteed mushrooms and chickpeas.
The portions are not huge, but the prices are reasonable ($7.50 as of 1/13/19).  The pita bread
is great as well.  It is thick, very soft, and bready.  For the amount
of hummus you get, the provided pita seems excessive, but that's no cause for
complaint.  If you're eating here around lunch, order online.  It gets very
busy during the lunch hour rush.  
People rave about the sandwiches and salads here.  I can't speak for them, but 
the immense influx of customers that swarm Bite around lunch suggest they are
quite good.
Though slammed by customers every single weekday, the service remains very friendly.  Bonus points for that.

<h2>Taim</h2>
<p>Taim falls into the category of places that I really, really wish I could have
loved.  It is less than a block from my place of employment, and I waited eagerly
for months as it was being constructed.  It is a beloved chain in NYC, founded
by an Israeli transplant.  And, knowing the quality of hummus and falafel in
Israel, I was very excited to see how it would compare. Unfortunately, it did not live up to the
hype that I built for it.  The portions are tiny, and the hummus, supposedly
prepared in small batches multiple times daily, is pretty bland.  The sides are
pretty bland as well, and everything just feels stingy.  All the dishes seem to 
either be missing spice, lemon, or both.  I will say, the pita is quite good.
It is also about half the size of a normal pita, but that suits the portions
of everything else on the menu.

<h1>Williamsburg</h1>

<h2>Hummus Market.</h2>
<p>Easily some of the best hummus I've had in NYC.  As the name suggests,
Hummus Market is _all_ about hummus.  You have a few options of toppings including
the classic tahini and some more eclectic options.  The service is top notch.
Being a sit down restaraunt, it is not your typical grab-and-go hummus joint.
It takes a few minutes to get your bowl, but it is served with fresh pita that,
so far, beats any I've had in NYC.  The service is super friendly, which makes
for a very pleasant dining experience as well.

<h2>Wafa's Express</h2>
<p>Wafa's is a great stop for a variety of cold and hot mezzes.  The hummus, however,
is merely good.  I was excited to try the baba ganoush after hearing rave reviews
about it, but that too, was "only" good.  It has the requisite smoky flavor, but it
was a bit too stringy and could've used a little more roast time in my opinon.  
I'd definitely go to Wafa's again.  The experience was good enough to deserve a second visit.
I should also add that the mujadara, which I ordered as the main dish in my vegetarian platter,
was excellent and large in portion.  The pita that accompanies the platter
is very thin, but it's passable considering the small portion of the hummus side.

<h1>Greenwich Village</h1>

<h2>Vish</h2>
<p>It's difficult to even compare Vish to the other contenders here.  This is an Israeli
operated restartaunt that is serving truly outstanding hummus of the likes you'd
find in Israel itself.  In addition to amazing hummus, you'll find the service
to be absolutely wonderful.  In Israeli tradition, refills of hummus are free,
so, in that regard, this is the best value in town too.  The pita is great,
the salad is great, and the post-meal coffee/cookies are complimentary. 
I don't understand how a restaraunt this generous can survive in the expensive
and bustling area of Midtown that it occupies, but I'm glad it does.

<h1>East Village</h1>

<h2>Mamoun's</h2>
<p>Mamoun's hummus definitely stands out among some of the others.  It has a great
garlicky kick.  It's served with a delicious assortment of pickled veggies.
If there's one thing to knock, it's the pita, which is neither warm nor fluffy.
Still, a highly recommended plate if you're in the area.

<h1>Tribeca</h1>

<h2>Nish Nush</h2>
<p>I was really hopeful for this one.  The hummus looks great, but it is just too
citrusy for my liking.  The falafel, on the other hand is great, as are all the
cabbages and salads.  I can recommend Nish Nush <i>highly</i> for these, but
the hummus alone I found a bit disappointing.

<h1>Union Square</h1>

<h2>Maoz</h2>
<p>I distrust anything near Union Square, but this is surprisingly good. There
are other locations, which are, presumably, no worse. The hummus is actually
quite outstanding.  It is a thinner consistency than most, which I am personally enjoy.  The baba ganoush is also great as are
the plethora of salads that are available.  I had this catered, which was an
excellent way to sample everything, but it seems that, unfortunately, the menu
is focused on sandwiches and salads.  It does include a hummus platter,
which is awesome, but it would be nice if there was a combo meal available
a la Hummus and Pita Co. so that people could sample the various options. Perhaps
if I'd dined in I would have been served the carefully rationed tourist portion
and my impression would be different, but, on quality alone, Maoz is pretty strong.
