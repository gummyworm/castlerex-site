<h3>Intro</h3>
<p>Hummus really is pretty  simple to make.  Although I am a fanatic and expend
a shocking amount of mental energy on thoughts of hummus, you are, in all likelihood, not.
Don't complicate things at the jeopardy of your own enjoyment
of the process. It's actually very hard to make <i>bad</i> hummus.</p>

<h3>Chickpeas</h3>
<hr>
<p>The first step to a great batch of hummus are the chickpeas.
Look, canned chickpeas are fine in a pinch. Any hummus is better than no hummus.
The result of a batch made from a can will be far superior (and cheaper) than
anything you'll find in the supermarket. But, for <i>great </i>hummus, there is no
alternative: you need to start with dried chickpeas.</p>

<p>I've experimented with various sizes. Many sources will say that you should use
the smallest chickpeas possible.  This is true.  You'll get noticeably smoother
hummus from small chickpeas.  I theorize that this is a result of the
decreased cook time required.</p>

<p>The difference between small and large chickpeas is quite small. Where
I live, there is thankfully an excellent middle eastern grocery that stocks 
the smaller variety of chickpea.  If you live in NYC, Kalustyans blessedly
stocks an absurd variety of radii. But chances are you'll have to go with the 
so-called "Garbanzo" beans stocked at many supermarkets.  Don't fret too much.</p>

<p>You'll need to soak the chickpeas before cooking them.  Rinse
the chickpease and add enough water to cover them with a couple inches.  
You've probably heard that is important to add baking soda to help soften the
beans. Again, this is good wisdom.  Add a good amount to the soaking water:
I usually go with a full Tbsp.</p>

<p>I've had good success soaking anywhere from 8-24 hours.  After soaking, rinse
the beans again and add to a pot to cook.  Cover the chickpeas again and add
a little more baking soda (somewhere under 1 tsp).  Too much baking soda in
the cooking water will impact the taste of that water, which is not good since
you'll want to use that water later on to thin the hummus to your desired
cosistency.</p>

<p>The cook time varies quite a bit depending on the size and age of your 
beans. You'll need to use your own judgment to determine when
they're done, but expect anywhere from 30 minutes to 2 hours. If it is taking
exceptionally long, it is probably due to a deficit of baking soda.</p>

<p>If you're lucky, the skins will detach after a short while of boiling at which point
you should scoop them from the surface and discard them.
This will make a HUGE difference in the texture of the hummus and, to some
extent, the taste.  I think hummus made without skins is truly indulgent, but
you will get a substanitally bigger batch with, presumably, far greater fiber
content if you leave the skins.  And of course, it will also cost you far less
effort to leave the membranes on the chickpeas. While you will rarely hear of
someone seeking grit in their hummus, I actually sometimes leave the skins on
to add a little texture.</p>

<p>When the chickpeas are done cooking, they should be almost mushy.  If you cook
them too long they will darken and your hummus will lose some visual appeal, but
don't worry too much- it will still taste great.  In fact, hummus from "overcooked" 
chickpeas reminds me of one of the greatest Hummusias I visited (repeatedly) in
Tel Aviv: Abu Adham.  If you're willing to accept the discoloration of a prolonged
cooking process, you can use another fun cooking hack: the slow cooker.
Put soaked chickpeas on high for basically as long as you want (4-10 hours)
and you'll have a usable, albeit unphotogenic, mush.</p>

<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<hr>
</p>I like to make a sauce from the remaining ingredients while the chickpeas cool.
To do this I add the juice of 1 lemon, about half a bulb of garlic, 1 1/2 tsp
of salt, 1 Tbsp of cumin, and at least 340g (about 1 cup) of tahini.
Put all the ingredients for this sauce into a food processor and mix with enough
cooking water to make a very light-colored and easily pourable liquid.
You should be able to easily pour the resulting mixture from the food processor
without needing to scrape.</p>
<p>This produces a sauce that is light on citrus, and heavy on garlic and tahini flavor.  
What I like about making this sauce separate is that you can isolate the variables that
you want to adjust when personalizing your hummus.  For me, this means relatively
little lemon.  It's fine to start with any one recipe, but you <i>WILL</i> want to
make adjustments to the ratios of these ingredients. You will probably want more
lemon.  Most hummus I've tried is a little citrusy for my taste, which must
mean the common palette prefers their hummus brighter than myself.</p>

<h3>Combining</h3>
<hr>
<p>Add some chickpeas to the food processor and pour in some of the tahini mixture
You may need to process the hummus in batches. If you skinned the chickpeas, it will
take less batching due to the lower overall volume.  I prefer to start with
a relatively dry batch and make it thinner as I go.  This makes the last batch
easy to extract cleanly from the food processor (again with little, if any, need
to scrape). Add more cooking water as you like to each batch to achieve the
desired consistency. Process each batch longer than appears to be necessary.
I like to run the processor for 5-7 minutes each batch.</p>

<p>The hummus will thicken considerably upon cooling, so it is wise to save the 
remaining cooking liquid for adjusting the texture later.  You can cool the
chickpeas to fridge temperature before processing, which will make the cooking
water a gel like consistency. Doing so will give you a better idea what the final
cooled product will be like.  You can also speed up the cooling process by
processing some ice with each batch of hummus.</p>

<p>Do not be discouraged at the amount of time you spend making hummus the first
time.  It is surprising how much more efficient you will get with each successive
batch. :)</p>

<h3>Storing and serving</h3>
<hr>
<p>Hummus needs to be refrigerated to prevent spoilage.
I've never had issues keeping hummus for 5 days.  More than that and you
may notice some deteriation in flavor, and I wouldn't advise trying to keep it
more than a week.</p>
<p>Absolutely, do not listen to anyone who suggests that "real" hummus is
best served fresh and warm. While it may be novel from time to time, in my experience it is best after being cooled
for at least 12 hours.  This is true with almost all Levantine
dips: baba ganouj, muhamara, etc. As well as so many other foods: salsas, chili, etc.
It's certainly worth trying hummus "fresh", but the flavors are noticeably more subtle.</p>

<p>There are 3 main ways to put your personal stamp on your hummus.  I've mentioned two:
the tahini/citrus/garlic ratio and the consistency.  The third is presentation.
This is the most fun part of the process in my opinion. I like to make a couple 
extra cups of chickpeas to keep for garnishing.  Make a small basin in the hummus and
fill the indentation with a scoop of warm chickpeas.  Around the chickpeas, 
drizzle some olive oil and sprinkle the dish with cumin and 
Hungarian paprika (regular paprika is fine too, I just like the bright color of
Hungarian).  The way that every Hummusia in Israel (a place unparalleled in 
hummus culture) presents their hummus is what
defines them.  It is a very simple dish, so to make a truly
memorable hummus is an art that inspires all the senses including sight.</p>
<p>Some other additions to try serving on your hummus: 
<ul>
	<li>chopped flat leaf parsley</li>
	<li>sliced boiled egg</li>
	<li>ful</li>
	<li>tahini sauce (a mixture of water and tahini)</li>
	<li>fried eggplant</li>
	<li>sauteed mushrooms and onions</li>
	<li>spicy tomato sauce (a la shakshuka)</li>
</ul>
<p>In Israel, ful, tahini sauce, and chickpeas are mostly standard options (very few
hummus joints will not offer them). And olive oil, parsley, and a generous array of spices are a default part of the presentation.
One of the best bowls of hummus I had in Tel Aviv (from a falafel joint called 
Mifgash Osher) was topped with fried cauliflower. Have fun and be as creative or traditional as you like!</p>
