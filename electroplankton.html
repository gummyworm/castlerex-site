<h1>Electroplankton</h1>

<p>
I'll preface this review with a little disclaimer.  Electroplankton is
my favorite video game of all time.  As such, this review is <i>extremely</i> biased.
Electroplankton, in my opinion, is a flawless work of art.
</p>

<p>
In my youth, I'm talkin' pre-teenager years, I was a devote follower of the Nintendo
official webpage.  It was very nearly the only webpage I ever visited.  I was also
obsessed with video games.  When I wasn't playing them, I was drawing ideas for my
own games. During this period, I could tell you every single game that was
released for the Gamecube and Gameboy Advance and what games were about to be released.</p>

<p>E3 was something of a religious event because of this.  Having no third-party
sources (outside the Nintendo forums), as to what games were on the horizon, it was
magical to see, at once, everything that developers were working on for Nintendo's
systems. Some of these releases appeared in "News" section on Nintendo's site, but
others were inconspicuously added to the so-called "Master Games List", a compilation
of all the officially released and announced games for Nintendo platforms.  A normal
person would probably not notice a game slipping into this list.  But I was no normal
Nintendo fan, so it did not get past me when a peculiarly titled game, <i>Electroplankton</i>, 
appeared on this list.</p>

<p>At this point, I really had seen it all.  I had looked at every, single game's
entry in the Master Game List.  I was acutely aware of the "types" of games out
there.  The puzzle game.  The 2D platformer. The <i>3D</i> platformer. You get
the idea.  So, when I opened Electroplankton, expecting some sort of budget Spongebob
action game, I was befuddled. This was the first game I'd seen that I couldn't
immediately classify under one of the labels that I had subconsciously divised.
It was just different in a way unlike in any game I'd seen before.  And the
details were so sparse.  I was intrigued and enamored.  I didn't have a name for
what it was at the time.  I actually insisted that <i>Electroplankton was</i>
a game when I firt heard of the age old kart/game debate, but in hindsight I
don't really know if that is a good label for it.  But game or not, it is art.
And it's impact on me has been quite possibly greater than any other single piece of art.</p>

<p>The "game" (I'll call it a game for the sake of this review), is divided into
10 different screens.  Each screen contains one or more of a certain organism
that the player interacts with via the touchscreen, microphone, and/or physical
buttons. The menu selection is presented with each organism individually selectable
via a simple two-screen display that provides a brief description on how to interact 
with the organism.</p>

<p>There are no objectives and no unlockables.  Accustomed to the linear progression
of virtually all traditional video games at the time, I was a bit phased upon first
opening the game to see this.  I'd heard before playing that you can sort of
make your own objectives.  Hannenbow, for example, is a creature that is launched
periodically from a leaf in the corner of the screen, ricocheting of another
plant and producing sounds as it plunks its way to the ground.  There is a "game" you can
play wherein you adjust the leaves of a plant so that the Hannenbow ricochet of
all the leaves before plunking back to the water.  After enough Hannenbow do this,
the leaves will all turn red and a flower will bloom.  Upon playing Electroplanktopn,
I quickly realized that this is the only thing that approaches any sort of objective.
But that's just fine. In fact, I love that Toshio Iwai didn't feel the need
to give players an objective.</p>

<p>One of my the organisms I had most fun playing with was "Volvoice". Volvoice
listens to the microphone input and mutates it depending on which shape it
is, which can be altered by selecting one of the bubbles that surrounds it.</p>
